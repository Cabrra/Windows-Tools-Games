+ Tile Editor
	+ This Tile Editor was a course project. I implemented another tile editor for the Unity engine based on this project. This tool is a level editor for a 2-D scrolling game. It loads in a tile set (a bitmap divided into tiles) and displays it in a window. In the another window it displays the map. You are able to select individual tiles in the tile set and then place them at the desired location in the map keeping the mouse button pressed down.

+ Particle Tool
	+ This tool was used in the ninja game who took us  months to develop. It animates the particle system to see how it would be in the game.
